class Environment(object):
    """All your Environment classes should inherit this interface.

    The environment defines the dynamics and the reward signal that the agent observes when interacting with it.

    An agent sees at any time-step from the environment a collection of observable elements. Observing the environment
    at time t thus corresponds to obtaining a punctual observation for each of these elements. According to the control
    problem to solve, it might be useful for the agent to not only take action based on the current punctual observations
    but rather on a collection of the last punctual observations. In this framework, it's the environment that defines
    the number of each punctual observation to be considered.

    Different "modes" are used in this framework to allow the environment to have different dynamics and/or reward signal.
    For instance, in training mode, only a part of the dynamics may be available so that it is possible to see how well
    the agent generalizes to a slightly different one.

        validation or generalization score. The mode the environment is in should always be redefined by resetting the
