Installation
==================

You can simply clone the version 0.1 of this framework by using the following command:

``
git clone -b 0.1 https://github.com/VinF/General_Deep_Q_RL.git
``

Assuming you already have a python environment with pip, you can automatically install all the dependencies (except ALE that you may need for atari games) with:

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

And you can install the framework as a package:

``
python setup.py install
``
