Welcome to DeeR's documentation!
==================================

DeeR (Deep Reinforcement) is a python library to train an agent how to behave in a given environement so as to maximize a cumulative sum of rewards.
It is based on the original deep Q learning algorithm described in :
Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning." Nature 518.7540 (2015): 529-533. (see :ref:`what-is-deer`)

Here are key advantages of the library:

* Contrary to the original code, this package provides a more general framework where observations are made up of any number of elements : scalars, vectors and frames (instead of one type of frame only in the above mentionned paper). The belief state on which the agent is based to build the Q function is made up of any length history of each element provided in the observation.
* You can easily add up a validation phase that allows to stop the training process before overfitting. This possibility is useful when the environment is dependent on scarce data (e.g. limited time series).
* You also have access to advanced techniques such as Double Q-learning and prioritized Experience Replay that are readily available in the library.

In addition, the framework is made in such a way that it is easy to 

* build any environment
* modify any part of the learning process
* use your favorite python-based framework to code your own neural network architecture. The provided neural network architectures are based on Theano but you may easily use another one.

It is a work in progress and input is welcome. Please submit any contribution via pull request.

What is new
