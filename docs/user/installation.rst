Installation
==================

You can simply clone the latest version of this framework by using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone -b master https://github.com/VinF/General_Deep_Q_RL.git

Assuming you already have a python environment with pip, you can automatically install all the dependencies (except specific dependencies that you may need for some examples) with:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt


And you can install the framework as a package:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python setup.py install
