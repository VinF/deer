:mod:`ALE environment`
=======================

This environment is an interface with the ALE environment that simulates any ATARI game. The hyper-parameters aim to simulate as closely as possible the following paper : Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning." Nature 518.7540 (2015): 529-533.

Some changes are still necessary to obtain the same performances.
