.. _naming_conv:

Naming convention for this project
----------------------------------

* All classes and methods have word boundaries using medial capitalization. Classes are written with UpperCamelCase and methods are written with lowerCamelCase respectively. Example: "two words" is rendered as "TwoWords" for the UpperCamelCase (classes) and "twoWords" for the lowerCamelCase (methods).
* All attributes and variables have words separated by underscores. Example: "two words" is rendered as "two_words"
* If a variable is intended to be 'private', it is prefixed by an underscore.
